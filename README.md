  An organized and responsive dashboard provides an overview of current flights, complete with filtering options to narrow down by airline, flight number, or status.

- **API Integration:**  
  Seamlessly integrates with external flight data providers (such as FlightAware, OpenSky Network, or other APIs) to ensure reliable and up-to-date information.

- **Modular & Scalable Codebase:**  
  Written with clean code and modular components, making it easy to extend functionality, integrate additional services, or customize for personal or enterprise use.
